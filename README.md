- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pcusg
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code. I'm an absolut beginner and curious how far i will come. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of HTML and HTML5. The first goal is to have a good understanding of Front End Developping.

There is always stuff to learn. The road to perfection is neverending.
